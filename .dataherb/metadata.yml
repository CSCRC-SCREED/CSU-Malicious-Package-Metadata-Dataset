name: Malicious Package Metadata Dataset
description: This dataset contains features engineered from NPM package metadata to predict whether a package is classified as malicious or benign. Features represent attributes such as versioning, dependencies, authorship, repository details, and scripts. The dataset provides comprehensive insights into the characteristics of NPM packages to assist in anomaly detection and classification tasks.
